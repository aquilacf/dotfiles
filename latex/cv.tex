	\cvsect{About me}

	A dedicated Software Engineer with experience in fintech, backend development, infrastructure management, and some entrepreneurship. My career progression reflects the feedback by the managers and mentors I had and commitment to learning. Outside of work, I maintain an active lifestyle through regular gym sessions, playing football, and supporting my family, which reinforces my disciplined approach to continuous improvement. Having recently ventured into entrepreneurship, I learned how much there still is to improve.
