#+TITLE: My personal emacs configuration.
#+AUTHOR: √Åquila Freitas

* Introduction
  After trying multiple ways to configure I have come to the conclusion to build simple settings in pure Elisp. You can check the git history to my old configuration. The reasons

  The reasons I moved away from the framework design was the implementation of `early-init` and `init`; also, I never really liked the idea to be honest.
  I also gave up the `org-mode` configuration because found myself never writing the documentation to justify its usage.

  This configuration consists of only `early-init` and `init` files. It creates a `.cache` directory in your `user-emacs-directory` and stores there all litter. Early initialization will load `priv.personal`
 for things that are not committed or custom code.

 Hopefully, my configuration won't grow to the point I need to use one of the setup styles I mentioned above.
